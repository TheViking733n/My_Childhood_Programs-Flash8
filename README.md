## Why I used Flash 8
I had a bunch of Flash games I used to play and I was very curious to make one by myself, but I had no idea how to make a Flash game. Soon after I reached in class 7th and Flash 8 was also in my school course book but they only taught animation in Flash, so I first started by making animation.

### My First Animation - [bounce ball](https://github.com/TheViking733n/My_Childhood_Programs-Flash8/blob/main/bouncyball.swf)

### Second Animation - [Game](https://github.com/TheViking733n/My_Childhood_Programs-Flash8/blob/main/Game.swf)
No wait, this is not an actual game. Its just an animation. As I was very excited to make a game, but didn't knew how so I just animated my imagination.

Thats the best I can draw with a mouse ;-D

### Fourth Animation (with sound effects) - 
I just added little sound effects in this animation and unfortunately this was my last animation. It took couple of weeks to complete and I realized that animation is not easy, especially when its done frame by frame.

Haha.. I know, ending is quite bad. I had no script while making the animation so I just ended with a suspense and never completed this story... 

### My actual Flash game - [Spill to safty 2](https://github.com/TheViking733n/My_Childhood_Programs-Flash8/blob/main/Spill%20to%20safty%202.swf)
After few months, I came back and made first ever Flash game
