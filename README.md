# My_Childhood_Programs-Flash8
This repo contains some of my Flash 8 animation, and how I made a simple Flash 8 game.

## Dependencies

## How to run these *.swf files
You can use the Flash Player provided in this repo to open the *.swf files.

## Why I used Flash 8
I had a bunch of Flash games I used to play and I was very curious to make one by myself, but I didn't knew how. Soon after I reached in class 7th and Flash 8 was also in my school course book but they only taught animation in Flash, so I started making my own animation.

### My First Animation - [bounce ball](https://github.com/TheViking733n/My_Childhood_Programs-Flash8/blob/main/bouncyball.swf)

### Second Animation - [Game](https://github.com/TheViking733n/My_Childhood_Programs-Flash8/blob/main/Game.swf)
No wait, this is not an actual game. Its just an animation. As I was very excited to make a game, so I just animated one.
